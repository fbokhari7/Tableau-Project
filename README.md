This project aims to create a Tableau dashboard for analyzing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB). The dashboard visualizes data related to TB cases and deaths, providing insights into the prevalence and impact of TB across different regions and populations.

Key Features:

Visualizations of TB cases, deaths, and treatment outcomes over time.

Geographic maps showing TB burden by country or region.

Interactive filters for exploring data based on parameter (HIV status).

Data Sources:

The project uses publicly available data from sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health agencies.

Dashboard Components:

Overview: Provides a summary of global TB burden metrics.

Trends: Visualizes trends in TB cases and deaths over time.

Geographic Distribution: Shows the geographic distribution of TB burden using maps.

The dashboard aims to provide policymakers, health professionals, and researchers with a comprehensive view of the global TB burden, helping to inform strategies for TB control and prevention.
